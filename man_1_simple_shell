.SH NAME
hsh \- The Holberton command interpreter (shell)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[file or arguements]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B  hsh
is a command language interpreter that executes commands read
from standard input or from a file. A full manual on documentation can
be found in the readme file.
.I hsh
does not handle any option processing like bash or zsh.
.SS Overview
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or a terminal,
interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It is the program
that is running when a user logs into the system.
.SH ARGUEMENTS
The first argument read from standard inputis assumed to be the command
and following arguments are its parameters. To invoke a script or file,
the first arguement is assumed to be the filename, no other options are
necessary.
.PP
.B hsh
reads and executes commands from standard input or the file, then exits.
.PP
.B hsh
exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the input.
If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attempt is first
made to open the file in the current directory, and, if no file is found
, then the shell searches the directories in PATH for the script.
.SH SHELL GRAMMAR
.B Simple Command
is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by a blank separated
words or redirectors, and terminated by a control operator. Blanks include
new lines, tabs. The first word specifies the command to be executed, and is
passed as arguement zero, the remaining words are passed as arguements to the
command.
.PP
Comments can be added to standard input using the
.B#
before any arguements or words to comment out.
.PP
.I Example:
echo qwerty
.PP
This will only write qwerty to standard output.
.SH PARAMETERS
A parameter is an entity that stores values. It can be a name, a number, or one
of the special characters listed below under Special Parameters. A variable is a
parameter denoted by a name.
.PP
.B Special Parameters
.PP
$Parameter
.PP
To view a list of all parameters and environemental variables, the builtin
.B env
is used. Or to view the value of a specific parameters simply
.PP
echo $parameter
.PP
in the standard input.
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the
environment. This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form name=value.
.PP
The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment. On invocation,
the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for each name found
, automatically marking it for export to child processes. Executed commands
inherit the environment.
.PP
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the wait system
call or equivalent function. If commands succeed, they return 1, else they
return 134. Builtin commands return 0 on success and 2 on failure.
.PP
If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns
a status of 134.
.PP
.SH SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
.B hsh
contains some builtin functions. These are listed below and do not support any
flags.
.PP
.B env
.PP
Prints out a list of all shell variables. Each variable is separated by a new
line. Each variable is outputed as followed
.I key=value
.PP
.I Example:
env
.PP
This prints out all the environemental variables and its values.
.PP
.B exit
.PP
The exit command terminates the current shell (or script).
If
the returned status the the status of the most recently
executed command (i.e. $?).
